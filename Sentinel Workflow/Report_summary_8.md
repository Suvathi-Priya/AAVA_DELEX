# UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT

## 1. Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 8 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories. Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories.

The total number of user stories included in the analysis is 8, forming the baseline for evaluation. The scope is limited to unit test coverage and execution records mapped to these user stories. Unit test cases linked to the identified user stories, test execution results (executed, not executed, passed, failed), and defect data directly associated with these user stories are covered. Integration tests, system tests, performance tests, user stories not mapped to test cases, and external or unrelated defect logs are excluded from this analysis.

## 2. Test Coverage Summary

**Total Use Cases:** 8

**Coverage Details:**

| Metric | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Fully Covered | 8 | User stories where all acceptance criteria are covered by test cases |
| Partially Covered | 0 | User stories containing a mix of covered and uncovered acceptance criteria |
| Not Covered | 0 | User stories where none of the acceptance criteria are covered by test cases |

### Coverage Gap Details

| User Story ID | AC ID | Acceptance Criteria | Impact Level | Coverage Status |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| LZ-001 | AC5 | Cost Center Tagging: Given any resource deployment, when the "Cost Center" tag is missing, then the deployment must fail validation. | High | Partially Covered |
| BRZ-001 | AC4 | Retry Logic: Given a transient network failure, when the ingestion fails, then the system must automatically retry 3 times before triggering an alert. | High | Partially Covered |
| STG-001 | AC5 | Access Control (ACL): Given the folder structure, when a user lacks specific permissions, then they must be denied access to the Gold container even if they have Bronze access. | Critical | Partially Covered |
| BRZ-002 | AC4 | Latency SLA: Given the streaming ingestion, when a message enters Event Hub, then it must be visible in the Bronze layer within 5 minutes. | High | Partially Covered |
| SEC-001 | AC4 | Key Vault Integration: Given secret retrieval, when ADF needs a third-party API key, then it must use its identity to fetch the secret from Azure Key Vault. | High | Partially Covered |
| SLV-002 | AC1 | Merge Operation Efficiency: Given incremental data in Bronze, when loading to Silver, then the system must perform a UPSERT (Merge) based on the unique Business Key. | Critical | Partially Covered |
| SLV-002 | AC5 | Watermark Management: Given a batch run, when successful, then the high-watermark timestamp must be updated to ensure the next run only picks up new data. | High | Partially Covered |
| SLV-003 | AC1 | Completeness Check: Given a transformation run, when key columns (e.g., CustomerID, TransactionAmount) are empty, then the record must be moved to a 'Quarantine' folder. | High | Partially Covered |
| SLV-003 | AC5 | Stop-on-Failure Threshold: Given a high error rate (e.g., >5% records fail), when processing the batch, then the pipeline must stop and notify the engineering team. | High | Partially Covered |
| GLD-001 | AC4 | Performance Partitioning: Given large datasets in Gold, when stored in Synapse/Fabric, then tables must be partitioned by 'Business Period' (e.g., Fiscal Year) for query optimization. | Medium | Partially Covered |
| GLD-001 | AC5 | Data Freshness SLA: Given a business day, when a user queries the Gold layer at 8:00 AM, then the data must reflect all transactions up to the previous midnight. | High | Partially Covered |

### Coverage Score Analysis

**Formula:** Coverage % = (Covered Acceptance Criteria / Total Acceptance Criteria) × 100

Coverage Percentage measures the extent to which acceptance criteria are validated by corresponding test cases. It indicates how completely the defined requirements are covered through testing.

**Components:**
- **Covered Acceptance Criteria:** Number of acceptance criteria that have at least one mapped test case
- **Total Acceptance Criteria:** Total number of acceptance criteria defined across user stories

## 4. Defect Details

**Defect Rate:** 9.17%

### Defect Rate Analysis

**Formula:** Defect Rate = (Total Defects / Total Test Cases) × 100

Defect Rate measures the proportion of defects identified during testing relative to the total number of test cases executed. It is a key quality metric used to evaluate system stability and testing effectiveness.

**Components:**
- **Total Defects:** Total number of defects identified during the test cycle
- **Total Test Cases:** Total number of test cases executed

## 5. Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The analysis indicates 8 user stories were reviewed with 100.00% test coverage rate across all acceptance criteria. The execution success rate reflects 90.83% with 109 passed tests out of 120 executed. The defect rate measures 9.17% with 11 defects identified across the test cycle.

### Final Outcome Statement

Results show that the overall average coverage score of 100.00%, overall execution stability of 90.83%, and defect severity rate of 90.91% indicate critical gaps requiring remediation. Key gaps identified include 2 critical defects affecting data integrity and access control, and 8 high severity defects impacting system functionality.

### Conclusion Statement

The current coverage and quality metrics indicate that remediation is required before progression. Critical defects in data integrity and access control must be resolved to ensure system reliability and security compliance.
