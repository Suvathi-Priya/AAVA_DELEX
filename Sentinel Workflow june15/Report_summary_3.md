# UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT

## Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 7 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories.

Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories. The user stories form the baseline for evaluation, covering unit test cases linked to the identified user stories, test execution results (executed, not executed, passed, failed), and defect data directly associated with these user stories.
